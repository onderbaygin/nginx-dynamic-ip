## Nginx dynamic domain ip via ssh 

### Why for?

I haven't static ip at my home. But i need to access the my home computer. For example: remote desktop, or localhost...

When your ip changes this script will update your domain/subdomain (i use for subdomain) nginx config file via your computer. 

Move this project to startup folder of your operating system.
